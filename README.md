**Probabilistic Programming in Fable**

This is the source code for the article here: http://metarecursive.com/writings/A_High_Level_Introduction_to_Differential_Privacy_and_Information.html. 

It is meant as an initial experiment of interactive explanations. 
And also, to learn about and test writing a simple Fable program. An additional benefit is using such clean syntax
in a probabilistic program (even if only discrete) that runs in the browser. In addition to the original Expert F# code, I added
the following features to make coding with the computation expression a bit more like typical probabilistic programming.

* Bayesian updating and likelihoods
* Mutual information
* Mutual Information and KL Divergence
* Text based Histogram plot

**Extra**

You can most easily play with the probabilistic programming code by copy and pasting code sections in https://gist.github.com/sir-deenicus/d8183d73ed12c2aa7d57f621c8a99ad1 into http://fable.io/repl/
