##Probabilistic Programming in Fable

This is the source code for the article here: . It is meant as an initial experiment of interactive explanations. 
And also, to learn about and test writing a simple Fable program. An additional benefit is using such clean syntax
in a probabilistic program (even if only discrete) that runs in the browser. In addition to the original Expert F# code, I added
the following features to make coding with the computation expression a bit more like typical probabilistic programming.

* Bayesian updating and likelihoods
* Mutual information
* Mutual Information and KL Divergence
* Text based Histogram plot
